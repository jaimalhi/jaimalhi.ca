				I'm a full-stack developer passionate about inspiring change and innovation. As a Software
				Systems student at Simon Fraser University, I strive to merge my academic pursuits with my
				passion for technology.
			</p>
			<br />
			<p>
				My love for all things technology can be seen in my academic endeavors, personal projects,
				and work for different organizations. I focus on using my skills to positively impact all
				aspects of life.

			<br />
			<p>
				When I'm not engaged in my academic or professional work, you can often find me exploring
				the outdoors, trying different cuisines, playing hockey, or jamming to some music. I am
				always open to new ventures and love getting hands-on experience!
