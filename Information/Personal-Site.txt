Website Idea:
- keep max width property ~60rem
- transparent navbar
- each section will be put in a grid like layout
  - the image to the left/right will following a space theme
    - moon, sun, stars, etc.
  - make the images rotate a little on hover
- slight line break between sections
- make the "about me" button on cover into a "download CV" btn
- maybe allow for emails/msgs to be sent to me in the content section
